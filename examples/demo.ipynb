    "\n",
    "The Medical AI Guardrails system implements a multi-layer safety pipeline with six detection systems:\n",
    "- **Emergency Detector** - Detects medical emergencies and provides immediate help resources\n",
    "- **Suicide Risk Detector** - Identifies suicide ideation and provides crisis support resources\n",
    "- **Prompt Injection Detector** - Blocks attempts to manipulate or bypass the system\n",
    "- **Privacy Guard (Input)** - Prevents personalized medical advice requests\n",
    "- **Privacy Guard (Output)** - Validates responses to ensure no personalized medical advice is provided"

Here are some evidence-based recommendations:\\n\\n1. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, aiming for at least 8 cups (64 ounces) daily. Limit sugary drinks and caffeine.\\n2. **Eat a Balanced Diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Aim for a variety of colors on your plate to ensure you're getting a range of nutrients.\\n3. **Exercise Regularly**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week. Include strength training, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and flexibility exercises to keep your body well-rounded.\\n4. **Get Enough Sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help your body repair and recharge. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.\\n5. **Manage Stress**: Engage in stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Take breaks throughout the day to stretch and move your body.\\n6. **Stay Connected**: Nurture your social connections and build strong relationships with family and friends. Social support can have a positive impact on both physical and mental health.\\n7. **Practice Good Hygiene**: Wash your hands frequently, especially during cold and flu season. Get vaccinated against preventable diseases, and practice safe sex to reduce the risk of STIs.\\n8. **Limit Screen Time**: Aim for less than 2 hours of recreational screen time per day. Use blue light filtering glasses or apps, and prioritize outdoor activities and face-to-face interactions.\\n9. **Get Regular Check-Ups**: Schedule annual health check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your health, discuss any concerns, and stay on top of preventive care.\\n10. **Don't Smoke**: Quit smoking or avoid starting in the first place. Smoking is a significant risk factor for many chronic diseases, including heart disease, lung cancer, and COPD.\\n11. **Limit Unhealthy Substances**: Be mindful of your intake of sugary drinks, saturated and trans fats, and excessive salt. Limit or avoid substances like tobacco, illicit drugs, and excessive alcohol.\\n12. **Stay Mentally Active**: Engage in activities that challenge your mind, such\", 'blocked_by': None, 'safe': True}\n"

      "Response: {'response': \"Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is consistently too high. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and is expressed as two numbers: systolic pressure (the top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number).\\n\\n**Normal blood pressure:**\\nA normal blood pressure reading is typically around 120/80 mmHg. The American Heart Association defines the following blood pressure categories:\\n\\n* Normal: Less than 120/80 mmHg\\n* Elevated: 120-129/80 mmHg\\n* Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139/80-89 mmHg\\n* Stage 2 Hypertension: 140 or higher/90 or higher mmHg\\n\\n**What happens when blood pressure is high:**\\nWhen blood pressure is high, it means that the heart is working harder to pump blood through the blood vessels. This can lead to damage to the blood vessels, heart, and other organs over time.\\n\\n**Effects of hypertension on the body:**\\nHigh blood pressure can affect various parts of the body, including:\\n\\n1. **Heart:** Increased workload on the heart can lead to heart failure, coronary artery disease, and cardiac arrhythmias.\\n2. **Blood vessels:** High blood pressure can cause blood vessels to narrow, harden, or even burst, leading to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup), aneurysms, and peripheral artery disease.\\n3. **Kidneys:** Hypertension can damage the kidneys' blood vessels, reducing their ability to filter waste and excess fluids, leading to kidney disease or kidney failure.\\n4. **Brain:** High blood pressure can increase the risk of stroke, cognitive decline, and dementia.\\n5. **Eyes:** Hypertension can cause blood vessels in the eyes to burst, leading to vision loss or blindness.\\n6. **Other organs:** High blood pressure can also affect the liver, pancreas, and other organs, increasing the risk of various health problems.\\n\\n**Symptoms of hypertension:**\\nUnfortunately, high blood pressure often has no noticeable symptoms, which is why it's essential to have regular blood pressure checks. However, some people may experience:\\n\\n* Headaches\\n* Dizziness or lightheadedness\\n* Nosebleeds\\n* Fatigue\\n* Shortness of breath\\n\\n**Risk factors:**\\nCertain factors can increase the risk of developing\", 'blocked_by': None, 'safe': True}\n"
