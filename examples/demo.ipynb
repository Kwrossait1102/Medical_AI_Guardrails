    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Medical AI Guardrails system implements a multi-layer safety pipeline with six detection systems:\n",
    "- **Emergency Detector** - Detects medical emergencies and provides immediate help resources\n",
    "- **Suicide Risk Detector** - Identifies suicide ideation and provides crisis support resources\n",
    "- **Prompt Injection Detector** - Blocks attempts to manipulate or bypass the system\n",
    "- **Privacy Guard (Input)** - Prevents personalized medical advice requests\n",
    "- **Privacy Guard (Output)** - Validates responses to ensure no personalized medical advice is provided\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working Pipeling\n",
    "\n",
    "User Input --> Emergency Detector --> Suicide Detector --> Injection Detector --> Privacy Detector for input --> Chatbot (Llama 3.3 70b Instruction) --> Privacy Detector for output --> Output\n"

      "1. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, aiming for at least 8-10 glasses. Limit sugary drinks and caffeine.\n",
      "2. **Eat a Balanced Diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Aim for a variety of colors on your plate to ensure you're getting a range of nutrients.\n",
      "3. **Exercise Regularly**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week. Include a mix of cardio, strength training, and flexibility exercises.\n",
      "4. **Get Enough Sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help your body repair and recharge. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.\n",
      "5. **Manage Stress**: Engage in stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Take breaks throughout the day to stretch and move your body.\n",
      "6. **Don't Smoke**: Smoking is a significant health risk, and quitting can greatly improve your overall health. If you're a smoker, consider seeking help from a healthcare professional or support group.\n",
      "7. **Limit Screen Time**: Aim to spend less than 2 hours per day on screens (e.g., TV, phones, tablets, computers) and prioritize outdoor activities or reading.\n",
      "8. **Stay Connected**: Nurture relationships with friends and family, and consider joining social groups or clubs to expand your social network.\n",
      "9. **Get Regular Check-Ups**: Schedule annual health check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your health and catch any potential issues early.\n",
      "10. **Practice Good Hygiene**: Wash your hands frequently, especially during cold and flu season, and avoid close contact with people who are sick.\n",
      "11. **Limit Processed and Packaged Foods**: Try to limit your intake of processed and packaged foods, which are often high in unhealthy ingredients like added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.\n",
      "12. **Get Enough Vitamin D**: Spend time outdoors, take vitamin D supplements, or eat vitamin D-rich foods like fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products.\n",
